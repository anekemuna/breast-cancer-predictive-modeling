# Breast Cancer Analysis and Prediction

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Breast Cancer dataset followed by the implementation of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

## Overview

The repository contains the following:

- Jupyter Notebook files showcasing the EDA process and model implementation

## Dataset

The [Breast Cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic) used in this project is sourced from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and consists of 569 instances with 30 features.

## File(s)

- `breast_cancer_predictions.ipynb`
  
## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/anekemuna/breast-cancer-predictive-modeling.git
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook files in the specified order to replicate the analysis and model implementation.

## Results

The SVM and Random Forest models achieved the following performance metrics:

- RF Accuracy: 0.97
- SVM Accuracy: 0.95
- RF F1-Score: 0.97
- SVM F1-Score: 0.95
